        <h2>The stimulus bill is under debate in the Senate, but votes are stalled by argument over jobless benefits.</h2>
        <p class="dateline">Friday, 3/5/2021</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Moderate and more progressive Democrats reached a compromise on decreasing weekly jobless benefits slightly while extending their timeline until September and decreasing their taxable amount.</li>
            <li>Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) objects to it, favoring the Republican alternative that keeps the $300 weekly benefit only until July.</li>
            <li>However, Democrats might be aided by the departure of Republican senator Dan Sullivan (R-AZ), who departed for his home state of Alaska today, making it unlikely that he will vote.</li>
            <li>It is uncertain when the benefits argument will be resolved, likely pushing voting on the bill to very late Friday or Saturday.</li>
            <li>The contents of the bill will likely include: direct payments of $1,400 per person (lesser amounts for those making more than $75,000 per year individually), 
                $350 billion aid for states and local governments to cover pandemic shortfalls, $245.8 billion to extend federal unemployment benefits, $128.6 billion to assist schools in reopening, 
                increase in child tax credits, aid for FEMA, aid for COVID testing and tracing, and aid for metro transit systems.</li>

        <h2>Old Updates:</h2>

        <h3>The stimulus bill is now under debate in the Senate.</h3>
        <p class="dateline">Friday, 3/5/2021</p>
        <ul>
            <li>After a party-line vote, with Vice President Kamala Harris breaking the 50-50 tie, Senate debate has begun on the stimulus bill also known as the American Rescue Plan.</li>
            <li>With zero Republican senators expressing support, Democrats will be attempting to pass the bill before current federal unemployment benefits expire on March 14.</li>
            <li>At the current pace, votes on amendments to the bill will occur this afternoon (3/5) and a final vote on the bill should occur this weekend.</li>
            <li>At the insistence of GOP Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI), the 628-page bill was read aloud before debate and votes can proceed.</li>
            <li>The contents of the bill will likely include: direct payments of $1,400 per person (lesser amounts for those making more than $75,000 per year individually), 
                $350 billion aid for states and local governments to cover pandemic shortfalls, $245.8 billion to extend federal unemployment benefits, $128.6 billion to assist schools in reopening,

        <h3>House lawmakers voted to approve the coronavirus relief package, the debate now moves to the Senate</h3>
        <p class="dateline">Saturday, 2/27/2021</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The bill, now called the American Rescue Plan, passed the House 219 - 212 late Friday night, with no Republicans voting in favor.</li>
            <li>The Senate will now have two weeks to debate and vote on the bill, before federal unemployment benefits expire on March 14.</li>
            <li>The Senate's parliamentarian ruled that the proposed minimum wage increase previously attached to the bill could not be passed with the budget reconciliation process carrying the bill.</li>
            <li>Democrats will need the support of all 50 members of their senators in order to pass the bill, with Vice President Kamala Harris breaking a tie.</li>
            <li>The contents of the bill include: direct payments of $1,400 per person (lesser amounts for those making more than $75,000 per year individually), 
                $350 billion aid for states and local governments to cover pandemic shortfalls, $245.8 billion to extend federal unemployment benefits, $128.6 billion to assist schools in reopening,

        <h3>A bill should be voted on by the full House near the end of this week. It won't include a minimum wage increase.</h3>
        <p class="dateline">Thursday, 2/25/2021</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Senate's parliamentarian, Elizabeth MacDonough, ruled that the reconciliation process that Democrat lawmakers are using cannot be used to raise the minimum wage.</li>
            <li>Democrats had hoped to include a measure that would raise the minimum wage gradually to $15 per hour by 2025.</li>
            <li>While Democrats expressed disappointment at the ruling, it may make the bill easier to pass through the Senate, where opposition to the wage hike was expected.</li>
            <li>The contents of the bill include: direct payments of $1,400 per person (lesser amounts for those making more than $75,000 per year individually), 
                $350 billion aid for states and local governments to cover pandemic shortfalls, $245.8 billion to extend federal unemployment benefits, $128.6 billion to assist schools in reopening, 
                increase in child tax credits, aid for FEMA, aid for COVID testing and tracing, and aid for metro transit systems.</li>
            <li>The bill, now referred to as the American Rescue Plan, is still expected to narrowly pass in the House along party lines.</li>

        <h3>On Monday, the House Budget Committee approved a bill, which may be voted on by the full House near the end of this week (Friday or Saturday).
        </h3>
        <p class="dateline">Wednesday, 2/24/2021 (out of date)</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The bill will next go to the House Rules Committee (which will meet on Friday morning, Feb. 26th), and then to the full House floor where it is expected to narrowly pass along party lines.</li>
            <li>Current contents of the bill include: direct payments of $1,400 per person (lesser amounts for those making more than $75,000 per year individually), 
                $350 billion aid for states and local governments to cover pandemic shortfalls, $245.8 billion to extend federal unemployment benefits, $128.6 billion to assist schools in reopening, 
                increase in child tax credits, aid for FEMA, aid for COVID testing and tracing, aid for metro transit systems, and a gradual increase to the federal minimum wage (to reach $15 in 2025).
            </li>
            <li>In Senate debate, it is possible that the bill could face hurdles, particularly with Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV), who opposes the minimum wage increase.</li>
            <li>Current federal unemployment benefits will expire on March 14, making that date a deadline that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) says the bill is on track to meet.</li>

        <h3>The stimulus is undergoing the House budget reconciliation process, but Congress is out this week.</h3>
        <p class="dateline">Tuesday, 2/16/2021 (out of date)</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Last week, House Democrats worked towards a plan that would provide direct payments of $1,400 per person (decreasing if one makes more than $75,000 a year), 
                extend unemployment programs to the end of August, boost federal unemployment payments from $300 to $400, extend food stamp benefit increases, 
                provide funds for state and local housing assistance, expand the child tax credit, provide funds for K-12 school reopenings, funds for vaccines and testing, 
                and increase the minimum wage to $15 an hour (in phases through 2025).</li>
            <li>This week, Congress is mostly out for a "district work period", where congresspersons return home to meet with constituents.</li>
            <li>The House could pass legislation next week, but in the Senate the bill is likely to face more opposition, 
                as Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ) have opposed raising the minimum wage.</li>
