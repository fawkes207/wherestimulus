        <h2>On Monday, the House Budget Committee approved a bill, which may be voted on by the full House near the end of this week (Friday or Saturday).
        </h2>
        <p class="dateline">Wednesday, 2/24/2021</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The bill will next go to the House Rules Committee (which will meet on Friday morning, Feb. 26th), and then to the full House floor where it is expected to narrowly pass along party lines.</li>
            <li>Current contents of the bill include: direct payments of $1,400 per person (lesser amounts for those making more than $75,000 per year individually), 
                $350 billion aid for states and local governments to cover pandemic shortfalls, $245.8 billion to extend federal unemployment benefits, $128.6 billion to assist schools in reopening, 
                increase in child tax credits, aid for FEMA, aid for COVID testing and tracing, aid for metro transit systems, and a gradual increase to the federal minimum wage (to reach $15 in 2025).
            </li>
            <li>In Senate debate, it is possible that the bill could face hurdles, particularly with Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV), who opposes the minimum wage increase.</li>
            <li>Current federal unemployment benefits will expire on March 14, making that date a deadline that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) says the bill is on track to meet.</li>

        <h2>Old Updates:</h2>
        <h3>The stimulus is undergoing the House budget reconciliation process, but Congress is out this week.</h3>
        <p class="dateline">Tuesday, 2/16/2021 (out of date)</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Last week, House Democrats worked towards a plan that would provide direct payments of $1,400 per person (decreasing if one makes more than $75,000 a year), 
                extend unemployment programs to the end of August, boost federal unemployment payments from $300 to $400, extend food stamp benefit increases, 
                provide funds for state and local housing assistance, expand the child tax credit, provide funds for K-12 school reopenings, funds for vaccines and testing, 
                and increase the minimum wage to $15 an hour (in phases through 2025).</li>
            <li>This week, Congress is mostly out for a "district work period", where congresspersons return home to meet with constituents.</li>
            <li>The House could pass legislation next week, but in the Senate the bill is likely to face more opposition, 
                as Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ) have opposed raising the minimum wage.</li>
